# Introduction

Rust is a new programming language with ambitious goals: in principle, Rust
is faster than C++ while being safer than Java, and easier to develop in than
both! In addition, Rust enables programmers to be fearless in the face of
concurrency and parallelism.

These are bold claims. What possible mechanism could enable this? Well, nothing
on its own is *truly* sufficient to make these claims. Rust largely just steals good
ideas from wherever it finds them. Piecewise, Rust isn't a particularly novel
language. This was in fact a specific design goal. Research is hard and slow.
As a whole, however, Rust has developed some interesting systems and insights.
The most important of these is *ownership*. Rust models data ownership in a
first-class manner unlike any other language in production today. To our knowledge,
the only language that comes even close to Rust in this regard is
[Cyclone][], which is no coincidence. Rust has sourced many great ideas from
Cyclone.

However Cyclone was largely trying to be as close as possible to C. As such,
many aspects of ownership weren't as well integrated or fleshed out as in Rust,
as legacy constraints got in the way. Cyclone has also unfortunately been
officially abandoned, and is no longer maintained or supported. By contrast,
Rust 1.0 was released last year, and the language has been going strong ever
since.

Ownership is not obviously some wonderful benefit though. Before we dive into
what ownership is and what it gains us, we need to understand the problems
it attempts to address.




# Trusting Data

Programming is hard. \[citation needed\]

One particularly interesting perspective on this problem is a relatively new
movement being championed by the game development industry: *data-oriented programming*
(not to be mistaken with data-driven programming). Data-oriented programming fundamentally
argues that programming isn't about code, but is rather about manipulating data.
The first step to writing a good program is not to design the code architecture,
but rather to understand the data you will be working with. Data-oriented
programs should not solve generic abstract problems, but rather solve the
exact problem at hand using using the specific properties of the data.

Consider a simple and well-studied problem: sorting. Without
understanding the data we're sorting, it's unlikely we will select the best solution. The
performance and applicability of different sorting algorithms depends heavily
on the distribution and type of the data. If you refuse to acknowledge any properties of
the data, you could reasonably settle on quick-sort, whose design explicitly
ignores any pre-existing properties.

However by understanding the data, we can potentially select a better sorting
algorithm. Insertion sort will outstrip quicksort on small or almost-sorted
data sets. Radix or bucket sort can be applied if we're sorting integers.
The cost of moving or comparing the data may also change which algorithm we
favour. In addition, most of these algorithms can be tweaked to optimize for
certain other properties of the data. For instance, much ink has been spilled
over how to best [select a pivot for quicksort][pivot-selection]. If you know
your data is truly random, you may as well select the first element unconditionally.

Some sorting algorithms try to detect these properties and change their
strategy on-the-fly, but this comes at the cost of increased complexity and
overhead compared to simply picking the right sorting algorithm *for our data*.
This strategy has also historically lead to mysterious performance cliffs, as some
inputs can trick the heuristics into [picking the wrong algorithm][sort-cliff].

This thesis is particularly interested in another aspect of data-oriented
programming: *trusting* the data. It's one thing to understand our data has
certain properties, it's another to actually *trust* the data to have these
properties. Trust takes many forms, and can have far-reaching consequences.

For instance, we may have experimentally determined that our data has a certain
distribution and can therefore best be sorted in some particular manner, but
how will our program behave if this assumption doesn't hold? Will we
perform slightly worse, produce incorrect output, crash, or have a security
hole?

We argue that data trust is a fundamental issue that can completely change how
one chooses to approach programming problems. Data-oriented programming argues
that we should understand our data, but it's trust that determines how we
actually on our understanding. In fact, we can organize programming languages
in terms of their approach to data trust.



## Trusting Languages

At one extreme, we have languages which generally unconditionally trust data,
and do little to justify this trust. The stars of this approach are C and C++.
These languages often expect data to have many non-trivial properties, and simply
declare that if those properties *don't* hold, the program is *undefined*.
Breaking the trust of these languages has dire consequences; the compiler is
free to misoptimize the program in arbitrary ways, leading to memory corruption
bugs and high severity vulnerabilities.

This is far from an academic concern:
exploits deriving from C(++)'s pervasive unsafety [are bountiful][c-exploits].
Modern compilers try to give a helping hand with debug assertions and static
analysis, but blind trust is evidently too deeply ingrained into these languages.
Programs written in these languages continue to be exploited, and no end to
this is in sight.

However in exchange for this great danger, these languages can produce highly
optimized programs, and give the programmer significant control. Trust can be
found in relatively small and local details like unchecked indexing as well as
massive and pervasive ones like manual memory management. These benefits are so
high-value that many programmers and problem-domains flat out refuse to even
consider a language without them. Manual memory management in particular is
regarded as sacrosanct by proponents of these languages. A new and safer language
that takes manual memory management away is simply irrelevant.





## Suspicious Languages

In the middle we have languages which will let
you *try* to do just about anything and strive to make it work, but largely
don't trust the data at runtime. This perspective is championed by the vast
majority of production languages: Java, Python, Ruby, Javascript, PHP, C#,
and many more.

These languages generally favour attempting to validate their data,
instead of trusting it. For instance it's common to silently check all array
indexing operations, and just crash the program if the check fails.

However the most interesting aspect of suspicion is the use of pervasive
garbage collection instead of manual memory management.
Garbage collection guarantees that data is always allocated as long as it's
reachable, enabling programs to blindly trust this property at the cost of
letting them control it.

Still, these languages generally let you write programs that are structured much
like a C(++) program at the high level. They just don't let you control
the low-level details as much, and will attempt to check assumptions where
possible. Of course, for some this *is* a fundamental change to the
way programs are written.

In exchange for this loss of control, these languages render entire classes of bugs
obscure. Garbage collection in particular completely eliminates the
use-after-frees, double-frees, and dangling pointers of trusting languages.
Runtime checks prevent buffer overruns, null pointer dereferencing, stack overflows, and other
miscellaneous safety issues. Although "prevent" here usually just means *definitely
crashes the program*, rather than *does anything at all*.

The biggest focus of these mechanisms is a group of problems that is generally
referred to as *memory safety*. Memory safety is honestly a bit of a vague concept,
but it largely boils down to accessing data that wasn't supposed to be accessed,
or otherwise isn't the data you expected. The vast majority of C(++) exploits
are generally memory-safety ones, so eliminating these bugs is a serious win.

This trades programmer control for some basic guarantees and peace-of-mind. For
some applications, the loss of control may have little to no impact. Especially if
the optimizer can actually prove that they are unnecessary through the wonders
of constant propagation and escape analysis. However for other applications the
impact may be a catastrophic orders-of-magnitude loss in performance. In
addition, these languages are still simply a non-starter for those that demand the
control of trusting languages.

Even though these languages generally eliminate the largest source of program
vulnerabilities, many major pieces of software continue to be written in C(++)
for these reasons. Kernels, browsers, and major libraries like GTK, Qt, and
OpenSSL all continue to be developed in C(++) in spite of languages like Java
and Python having existed for decades. This is no accident. C(++) is regarded
as the best language for the job, and users of these pieces
of software (literally everyone with a computer or phone) continue to be
exploited as a result.

However it should be noted that suspicious languages are not a panacea. Programs written
in these safer languages still suffer from serious security vulnerabilities, and other
pernicious bugs.

First and foremost, some bugs are simply a matter of bad policy, which can never
truly be prevented. If you forgot to sanitize some input, mess up some
cryptographic operation, or just validate data incorrectly, there's little that
can be done. These mistakes can be fought against by encoding policy
requirements at the type level, but someone still has to correctly develop a
bullet-proof encoding of requirements into types, and everyone else has to produce
programs that use the *right* types. Although this is an interesting problem,
and we have found that Rust can be *helpful* with it, we do not attempt to address
it in this work.

Second, all of the bugs of C can be recreated by a sufficiently
bad design. If you decide to reinvent the allocator with a big array of pre-allocated
objects with indices for pointers, there's little that a suspicious language can do to
protect you from performing the equivalent of a use-after-free on the elements in
this array.

Third and finally, while crashing the program because you did something bad is in some sense
*better* than getting exploited, it's not exactly *great*. Your program is still
wrong, users are getting random crashes, and you still need to waste tons of
time figuring out what happened. Ideally, these bugs would be caught
and prevented *before* the program was actually executed. Just about
any problem you can think of can be prevented statically. It just
involves forbidding some perfectly sound programs. Even the halting problem can
be solved if you just disallow every program that your analysis fails on.
The big question is how much of a burden it is to eliminate these bugs.

Some bugs are especially resilient to elimination. Indexing out of bounds is perhaps
the most notable example. It *is* possible to statically guarantee that all indexing
operations are in-bounds, but the necessary machinery is quite heavy-weight.
The resulting programs will likely need a significant amount of annotation and
massaging.

Other problems, on the other hand, can be more readily eliminated. Of particular
interest to us is the problem of *view invalidation*. The abstract
problem is simple: when one piece of code is viewing some state that another
piece of code is mutating, the view may become corrupted, causing incorrect
behaviour.

A classic example of this problem is *iterator invalidation*: mutating a data
structure while iterating it. Java's standard collections all explicitly check
for this at runtime, and will throw a ConcurrentModificationException if it
is detected. C++, by contrast, just states that this is Undefined
Behaviour.

Certain data structures and iteration approaches are more or less resilient to
iterator invalidation issues. For instance, if you iterate a growable array
by holding a pointer into it, a reallocation may leave your pointer dangling
or pointing at stale data. If you instead hold an index, then you may not notice
a reallocation.

Binary trees can often be safely mutated during
iteration if they have parent pointers, in which case the iterator can just hold
a pointer to a node, which is stable unless that node's element is removed. However
without parent pointers the iterator must maintain an *array* of parent node
pointers which becomes inconsistent if the path to the current node
changes.

View invalidation is especially nasty in a threaded context, where it becomes
difficult to debug or even reproduce. Worse, in a threaded context we are
introduced to a particularly degenerate form of view invalidation: data races.
Data races occur when one thread tries to read a location in memory while another
writes to it without appropriate synchronization. What the reader sees at that
point is completely up in the air. Needless to say, data races aren't great
for program correctness.




## Paranoid Languages

At the other extreme of the spectrum, we find the exotica of languages which
are truly paranoid about their data. In particular, these languages try to
minimize or isolate mutation and other side-effects which may invalidate their
data. Haskell is perhaps the poster-child for this approach, and is joined in
varying degrees by Prolog, Erlang, and tons of other languages.

In contrast to the suspicious languages, the paranoid languages are typified
by expecting programs to be expressed in a fundamentally different
manner, and a greater loss of programmer control. It could be argued that this
is for the best, and that these approaches are simply superior. However we are
unaware of any significant proof of this, and even if proof *did* exist it would
be immaterial to us.

Simply declaring that everyone else is incorrect isn't an excellent strategy for
adoption. Operating systems, web browsers, core libraries, and most applications
certainly aren't written in a pure-functional manner. In the jump to
paranoid languages we evidently lose an even larger chunk of the programming
populace.

In exchange, several of the problems that the suspicious languages suffer
from are eradicated. Indeed, many of those problems arose from being able to
mutate data. View invalidation and data races are *defined* in terms of mutation!
Being able to mutate and reuse state is also a necessary pre-condition to
recreating several of the classic C bugs in a garbage-collected context. No
longer can you create an array of reusable pre-allocated objects, because the
very act of allocating them fixes their representation.

It's worth noting that these strong restrictions *can* enable interesting
optimizations that wouldn't normally be viable. Because the programmer has so
little control, the compiler can trust all the data much more, and transform the
program much more aggressively. Perhaps the most well known of these optimizations
is Haskell's [list fusion][], which completely eliminates intermediate lists
based on observations like purity.

Indeed, an optimizing compiler is generally transforming
the program to either leverage the knowledge it has about data, or to acquire
more knowledge. Constant folding, branch elimination, alias analysis, and escape
analysis all boil down to proving facts about data at a certain point in a program.
Inlining, by contrast, is often most valuable for its ability to give the
inlined code more information about the data it is being given.

Trusting languages can also be aggressively optimized because they blindly trust
data to have properties. Suspicious languages therefore in some sense occupy
an unfortunate middle-ground in terms of compiler optimizations. They can't
blindly trust data, but they also don't have a lot of information about that
data either. Just-in-time compilers can recover from this by observing the
program as it executes and optimizing based on actual usage. However a lack
of data trust ultimately requires these optimizers to be pessimistic.





# Ownership

Rust tries to be a practical language. It understands that each of the
above groups has good ideas and problems. Rust is greedy though, so it only
wants the good ideas with none of the associated problems. From each category,
it takes one major insight, but it doesn't take their solutions.

From the trusting languages, Rust takes the idea that low-level control is important.
From the suspicious languages, Rust takes the idea that memory safety is important.
From the paranoid languages, Rust takes the idea that pervasive mutation causes problems.
However Rust does not embrace garbage collection as the solution to memory safety,
nor does it embrace that minimizing *all* mutation is the solution to other problems.

Instead, Rust solves all these problems with ownership. The ownership model has
two major aspects: controlling where and when data lives; and controlling
where and when mutation can occur. These aspects are governed by two major
features: affine types and regions.





## Affine Types

At a base level, Rust manages data ownership with an *affine type system*. The
literature often describes affine types as being usable *at most once*, but from
Rust's perspective affine typing primarily means values are *uniquely owned* by default.
That is, if a variable stores a Map type, passing it to a function by-value or
assigning it to another variable transfers ownership of the value to the new location.
The new location now can *trust* that it has unique access to the Map, and the
old location loses all access to the Map. When this occurs, the value is said to
be *moved*.

The owner of a Map in turn knows that it can safely do whatever
it pleases with the value without interfering with someone else. The greatest of these
rights is destruction: when a variable goes out of scope, it destroys its value forever.
This can mean simply forgetting the value, or executing the type's destructor.
In the case of a Map, this would presumably be freeing its allocations.

Affine types are primarily useful for eliminating the *use-after* family of bugs.
If only one location ever has access to a value, and the value is only invalidated
when that one location disappears, then it's trivially true that you cannot use
an invalidated value. The most obvious applications of affine typing are with various
forms of transient resources: threads, connections, files, allocations, and so on.

However it turns out that a surprising number of problems can be reduced to a
use-after problem. For instance, many APIs require some sequence of steps to
be executed in a certain order. This can be encoded quite easily using affine
types:

```rust
fn first() -> First;
fn second(First) -> Second;
fn third(Second) -> Third;
fn alternative(First) -> Alternative;
```

Using affine types, valid control flow can be modeled at the type level to statically
ensure correct usage. This can be done with a light hand, or a heavy hand.
At the light end one can use it to hint at correct usage or avoid obvious errors.
At the heavy end, one can push the entire program into the type system, as is
the case for *[session types][]*. Once the signatures for such programs are written,
the programs are said to "write themselves" as the only valid operations to perform
are exactly those that should be performed.

Rust does not support *linear* typing, which requires that values be used
exactly once. This means that in Rust it is always a valid option to simply drop
a value on the ground and forget about it. Linear types can be quite useful when
doing this kind of type-level encoding of logic, but Rust currently excludes
them as a practical matter.

First off, many of the use cases can be handled by affine types
in conjunction with destructors: some default task that must be done at the end.
However this is insufficient when additional information must be provided to
complete the task. For instance, an allocation may need its allocator passed to it
to clean itself up. In these cases, it may be sufficient to use a *destructor bomb*:
a destructor that crashes the program. This of course allows incorrect programs to
be compiled, but will hopefully quickly crash them in basic smoke-testing.

For most programs this will catch any reasonable error, assuming a non-malicious
programmer. However Rust *does* allow for values to be permanently leaked, in
which case their destructors will never run. The standard library explicitly
exposes a function for doing exactly this: `mem::forget`. However it is also
possible to leak destructors accidentally. For instance, if a reference-counted cycle
becomes unreachable, its data will never be destructed. At first this sounds quite
serious, but reference-counting in Rust is fairly rare, and other aspects of ownership
we will see later mean cycles are even rarer.

This was the most important practical reason why Rust doesn't provide true
linear types: being able to express programs that *could* leak was deemed too
valuable. Modeling the ability to leak as some kind of effect system was briefly
considered, but ultimately rejected for not carrying its weight (effect systems
are generally a pain to work with, so Rust uses them sparingly).

In practice this has not been a serious issue for end-users of an API: leaking
destructors is effectively a convoluted action that no one ever needs to worry
about doing accidentally. However this is an issue for *designers* of an API:
soundness cannot rely on a destructor running. When this was fully realized,
3 standard library APIs had to be modified (although two of them were only
modified at the implementation level). We will explore these problems and their
solutions in a later section.

Affine typing is not mandatory. Rust has a Copy kind (an empty interface) that types
may opt into if they consist only of other Copy types, and don't provide a
destructor. Copy types behave like any other value with one simple caveat:
when they're moved, the old copy of the value is still valid. This is used by
most of Rust's primitives types like booleans and integers, as well as many
simple composites.

Copy semantics can have surprising consequences though.
For instance, it may be reasonable to implement Copy for a random number
generator (their internal state is generally just some integers). It then
becomes possible to accidentally copy the generator, causing the same
number to be yielded repeatedly. For this reason, many types which *could* be
copied safely don't opt into Copy. In this case, affine typing is simply a lint
against what is likely, but not necessarily, a mistake.





## Borrows and Regions

Affine types are all fine and good for some stuff, but if that's all Rust had,
it would be a huge pain in the neck. In particular, it's very common to want
to *borrow* a value. In the case of a unique borrow, affine types can encode
this fine: you simply pass the borrowed value in, and then return it back.
This is, at best, just annoying to do. Borrows must be "threaded" throughout
such an API explicitly in both the types and code.

However affine types really hit a wall when data wants to be *shared*. If
several pieces of code wish to concurrently read some data, we have a serious
issue. One solution is to simply *copy* the data to all the consumers. Each
has their own unique copy to work with, and everyone's happy. However, even
if we're ignoring the performance aspect of this strategy (which is non-trivial),
it may simply not make sense. If the underlying resource to share is truly affine,
then there may be *no* way to copy the data in a semantic-preserving way.

At the end of the day, having only values everywhere is just dang *impractical*.
Rust is a practical language, so Rust has a solution: pointers! Unfortunately,
pointers unleash a fresh new hell of errors for us to make. Affine types "solved"
use-after errors for us, but pointers bring them back and make them *far* worse.
The fact that data has been moved or destroyed says nothing of the state of
pointers to it. As C has demonstrated since its inception, pointers are all too
happy to let us view data that might be destroyed or otherwise invalid.

This is why pervasive garbage collection is such a popular solution to memory safety.
However Rust does not include pervasive garbage collection. Rather, Rust's
solution to this problem is Cyclone's most significant contribution to
the language: [regions][cyclone-regions].

Like affine types, regions are something well established in both theory and
implementation. Although Rust primarily steals them from Cyclone, they were first
[described by Tofte and Talpin][tofte-regions] and used in an ML implementation.
However Cyclone's implementation of the scheme is most immediately recognizable
to a Rust programmer. The heart of the system is that pointers are associated with
a region of the program that they're valid for, and the compiler ensures that
pointers don't escape their region. This is done entirely at compile time, and
has no runtime component.

For Rust, these regions correspond to lexical scopes, which are roughly speaking
pairs of matching braces (though many unwritten scopes exists for e.g. temporaries),
and are called *lifetimes*. The restriction to lexical scopes is not fundamental,
and was simply easier to implement for the 1.0 release.

At a base level, all a region system does is statically track what pointers are
outstanding during any given piece of code. By combining this information with
other static analysis it's possible to completely eliminate several classes of error
that are traditionally relegated to garbage collection. First and foremost,
we track the paths that are borrowed (for instance `variable.field1.field2`).
Knowing this, we can then statically identify when a value is moved or destroyed
while being pointed to, and produce an error to that effect.

However, when combined with an affine type system we get something more powerful
than garbage collection. For instance, if you `close` a File in Java, there is
nothing to prevent old pointers to the File from continuing to work with it. One
must guard for this at runtime. However in Rust, this is simply not a concern:
it's statically impossible.

Unfortunately, this alone does nothing for finer-grained data invalidation. For
instance, what if we have a pointer to a growable array, as well
as a pointer *into* the array? If the array can be told to `pop` an element through a
pointer, then the element can become invalidated. There are several ways we could
approach this problem.

The most extreme solution is to simply forbid internal pointers. Then we never
have to worry about them being invalidated. Unfortunately this throws a way a
ton of the value of pointers. Interior pointers are really useful.

Another way is to teach the region system about this data structure in
a deep way. Teach it that the pointer points to some internal data of the array,
and that the `pop` operation moves that data. This of course raises the
question of granularity: does this system know about individual elements of the
array, or does it consider all of the elements in the stack to be some opaque blob?
If the former, does it allow us to pop the array if we don't have a pointer to
the last element? Going down this road quickly leads to a very complicated
type system, or just tracking these properties at runtime. Neither is desirable.

Yet another way is to treat all pointers into the array as pointers *to*
the array, and simply forbidding mutation through pointers. All mutating operations
could require by-value access, which could be done with borrow-threading.
This is unfortunate because we were trying to avoid borrow-threading by introducing
pointers in the first place. But hey, at least we can share data immutably,
which is still a definite win.

Rust basically takes this approach, but in order to avoid the annoying pain of
threading borrows, it includes two different *kinds* of pointer:
*mutable references*, and *shared references*, denoted `&mut` and `&`
respectively. Shared references are exactly as we described: they can be
freely aliased, but only allow you to read the data they point to. Mutable
references on the other hand must be unique, but enable mutation of the data
they point to. This means that taking a mutable reference to some data is like moving
it, but then having the compiler automatically insert all the threading junk
to move it back into place when the mutable reference is gone (of course, the
compiler does not actually move the data around when you take a mutable
reference).

This is Rust's most critical perspective on ownership: mutation is mutually
exclusive with sharing. In order to get the most out of this perspective, Rust
also doesn't allow mutability to be declared at the type level. That is, a struct's
field cannot be declared to be constant. Instead, the mutability of a value is
*inherited* from how it's accessed: if you have something by-value or
by-mutable-reference, you can mutate it.

This stands in contrast to the functional perspective that mutation is simply
not okay. However even though
we're more permissive than functional languages, we end up eliminating many of
the same problems. Iterator invalidation (and equivalent view invalidation bugs)
are no more under this scheme, because an iterator borrows the collection,
preventing anyone else from mutating it.

This strategy also nicely generalizes to a concurrent context. A data race is
defined to occur when two threads access a piece of data in an unsynchronized
way, and one is writing. This is exactly aliasing and mutation, which is
forbidden by Rust's scheme. As such, everything in Rust is threadsafe by default.
However concurrent algorithms and data structures are rife with aliasing and
mutability. Mutexes exist *precisely* to enable aliasing and mutation in a
controlled manner.

As a result, although inherited mutability is the default way to do things in
Rust, it is not the only way. A few key types provide *interior mutability*,
which enables its data to be mutated through shared references, with some
runtime mechanism to ensure that mutable references aren't aliased. The most
obvious example of this is exactly the standard library's Mutex type, which
allows an `&Mutex<T>` to become an `&mut T` by acquiring its lock.




# Unsafe Rust

We originally separated all programming languages into two major categories:
those that are safe, and those that are unsafe. This is of course a ridiculous
over-simplification. In fact, basically *every* language has unsafe bits that
make the language totally unsound. The most fundamental of these is quite
simple: talking to C. C is the lingua-franca of the programming world. All
major operating systems and many major libraries primarily expose a C interface.
Any language that wants to integrate with these systems must therefore learn
how to talk to C. Because C is *definitely* unsafe and can do just about anything,
to your program, these languages then become transitively unsafe.

Rust is no different, but it does embrace this reality a little more than most
other languages. Rust is actually *two* languages: Safe Rust, and Unsafe Rust.
Safe Rust is the Rust we have been focusing on for the most part. It
is intended to be completely safe with one exception: it can talk to
Unsafe Rust. Unsafe Rust, on the other hand, is definitely not a safe language.
In addition to being able to talk to C (like any safe language), it enables the
programmer to work with several constructs that would be easily unsound for
Safe Rust. Most notably, Unsafe Rust includes raw C-like pointers which are
nullable and untracked.

At first glance, Unsafe Rust appears to completely undermine Rust's claims about
safety, but we argue that it in fact *improves* its safety story. In most safe
languages, if you need to do something very low level (for performance, control,
or any other reason) the general solution to this is "use C".

This comes with a very significant cognitive overhead. Your application now has
its logic spread across two completely different languages with different
semantics, runtimes, and behaviors. If the safe language is what your team
primarily works in, it's unlikely that a significant percentage of the team is
qualified to actively maintain the C components.

It also incurs non-trivial runtime overhead. Data must often be reformatted at
the language boundary, and this boundary is usually an opaque box for either
language's optimizer.

Finally, falling back to C is simply a *huge* jump in unsafety, from "totally
safe" to "pervasively unsafe".

Unsafe Rust largely avoids these issues with one simple fact:
it's just a superset of Safe Rust. Lifetimes, Affine Types, and everything else
that helps you write good Rust programs are still working exactly as before.
You're just allowed to do a few extra things that are unsafe. As a result,
there's no unnecessary runtime or semantic overhead for using Unsafe Rust.

Although of course you do need to understand how to manually uphold Safe Rust's various
guarantees, which is non-trivial. However even this is a better situation than
using C, because the unsafety is generally much more modular. For instance, if
you use Unsafe Rust to index into an array in an unchecked manner, you don't
suddenly need to worry about the array being null, dangling, or containing
uninitialized memory. All you need to worry about is if the index is actually
in bounds. You know everything else is still normal.

In addition, Unsafe Rust doesn't require any kind of complicated foreign function interface.
It can be written inline with Safe Rust on demand. Rust's only requirement is that you
write the word `unsafe` *somewhere* to indicate that you understand that what
you're doing is unsafe. Since unsafety is explicitly denoted in this manner, it
also enables it to be detected and linted against if desired.

Rust's standard library (which is written entirely in Rust) makes copious use of
Unsafe Rust internally. Most fundamentally,
Unsafe Rust is necessary to provide various operating system APIs because those are
written in C, and only Unsafe Rust can talk to C. However Unsafe Rust is also used in
various places to implement core abstractions like mutexes and growable arrays.

It's important to note that the fact that these APIs unsafe code is entirely an
implementation detail to those using the standard library. All the unsafety is
wrapped up in *safe abstractions*. These abstractions serve
two masters: the consumer of the API, and the producer of the API. The benefit to
consumers of an API is fairly straight-forward: they can
rest easy knowing that if something terrible happens, it probably wasn't their
fault. For producers of the API, these safe abstractions mark a clear boundary
for the unsafety they need to worry about.

Unsafe code can be quite difficult because it often
relies on stateful invariants. For instance, the capacity of a growable array
is a piece of state that unsafe code must trust. However within the array's
privacy boundary, this state can be arbitrarily manipulated by anyone. The
abstraction boundary is often exactly where privacy kicks in, preventing
consumers of the API from doing arbitrarily bad things to the state unsafe
code relies on.

This thesis focuses primarily on these safe abstractions. A good safe abstraction
must have many properties:

* Safety: Using the abstraction inappropriately cannot violate Rust's safety guarantees
* Efficiency: Ideally, an abstraction is *zero cost*, meaning it is as efficient
  at the task it is designed to solve as an unabstracted solution (with a decent
  optimizing compiler).
* Usability: A good abstraction should be more convenient and easy to understand than
  the code it's wrapping.

It would be *excellent* if the implementation was also completely safe, but we
do not consider this a critical requirement.

It should be noted that Rust's reliance on safe abstractions is, in some sense,
unfortunate. For one, it makes reasoning about the performance characteristics
of a program much more difficult. It has also left Rust's unoptimized
performance in a rather atrocious state. It is not uncommon for a newcomer to
the language to express shock that a Rust program is several times slower than
an equivalent Python program, only to learn that enabling optimizations makes
the Rust program several times faster than Python.

However it is our opinion that this is simply fundamental to providing a
programming environment that is safe, efficient, and usable.




# Designing APIs for Trust

It has been our experience that almost everything you want to express at a high level
can be safely, efficiently, and usably expressed in an ownership-oriented system.
However this does *not* mean that you can express it however you please!
In order to achieve all of these goals, the API itself must model and work
around the issue of data trust. If the API does not correctly work with trust,
then it will either be unsafe (in which case there is an aspect of blind trust),
inefficient (in which case there is an aspect of suspicion), or unusable (in which
case trust was achieved in an annoying or unintuitive way).

Consider a relatively simple problem: indexing into arrays. As we have noted,
indexing out of bounds is a fundamental memory safety violation. There are three
major strategies for indexing: blindly trust the value, blindly check the value, or
statically prove the value is valid.

Blindly checking the value is the most common strategy, because it's safe, easy to
use, and easy to implement. Blind trust is of course unsafe, but generally more
efficient. Statically validating the value is in principle the best of both worlds:
maximally efficient, and even safer than the checked version because it's guaranteed
to succeed at runtime. However statically proving all indexing is in bounds is
suffers from the usability perspective. Using dependent types, it *is* possible to
statically verify some bounds checking, but it takes a pretty significant extension
to most languages to support this.

Due to the significant complexity of dependent types, Rust opted for the runtime
checking solution. Interestingly, even though Rust programs are
*semantically* unconditionally performing bounds checks, we don't unconditionally
lose performance.

First off, these bounds checks are by definition trivially predictable in a
correct program. So the overhead at the hardware level is quite small. However
incurring  perfect branch predicts is the worst-case. A good optimizing compiler
(like LLVM) can optimize away many bounds checks. For instance, the following
code doesn't actually perform any bounds checks when optimized, because LLVM can
see that the way the indices are generated trivially satisfies the bounds
checking.

```rust
let mut x = 0;
for i in 0 .. arr.len() {
    x += arr[i];
}
```

Indeed, if you can convince LLVM to not completely inline and constant-fold
this code away, it will even successfully vectorize the loop!

However compiler optimizations are brittle things that can break under even
seemingly trivial transformations. For instance, changing this code to simply
iterate over the array *backwards* completely broke LLVM's analysis and produced
naive code that adds the integers one at a time with bounds checking. This is
perhaps the most serious cost of bounds checks: inhibiting other optimizations.

If we really care about avoiding this cost, we can't just rely on the optimizer
to magically figure out what we're doing: We need to actually not do bounds
checking. Arrays in Rust expose an unsafe unchecked version of indexing
for exactly this situation. However this is an unfortunate trade to make:
guaranteed unchecked iteration puts memory safety at risk.

Thankfully, this is a false dichotomy. This code is hard to optimize safely
because we've pushed too much of the problem at hand to the user of the array.
They need to figure out how to generate the access pattern, and we in turn can't
trust it. If the array itself handles generating the access pattern *and*
acquiring the elements, then all the bounds checks can be eliminated at the
source level safely. This is handled by a tried and true approach: iterators.

```rust
let mut sum = 0;
for &x in arr.iter() {
    sum += x;
}
```

This produces the same optimized code as the original indexing-based solution,
but more importantly, it's more robust to transformations. Iterating
backwards now also produces vectorized unchecked code, because the optimizer
has less to prove about our data.

As an added bonus, client code ends up simplified as well, as all
the error-prone iteration boiler plate has been eliminated.
Of course, this adds more implementation burden to the developer of an API.
Special access patterns that can be optimized cannot generally be built
by an external client unless an unsafe "raw" API is also exposed. For arrays,
there *is* a raw API because it's simple and obvious. However
complexity basically only goes up from arrays, and this may not always be
reasonable to do.

Note that it is *not* sufficient for the array to *just* produces the indices.
Even if the indices were wrapped in an opaque type so they couldn't be modified,
they could be stored until they're no longer valid, or passed to a completely
*different* array, which has no way to identify which array the indices originated
from. Only by building a complete abstraction wrapping the whole iteration
process can we obtain sufficient data-trust to produce a satisfactory result.

It turns out that ownership provides us with powerful tools for manufacturing
data trust. For instance, escape analysis is notable in garbage collected
languages for its ability to avoid allocating memory on the heap at all by proving
that data does not escape some region of the code. Rust's lifetimes are exactly
for proving that data does not escape some region. However, instead of a failed analysis
producing a less efficient program, it prevents the program from compiling *at all*.
Rust is simply a garbage collected language with perfect escape analysis,
allowing the implementors to not implement the actual garbage collector at all.

Affine types in turn give us powerful aliasing guarantees. An iterator cannot
be invalidated because aliasing and mutation is a compiler error, and not simply
the optimizer's slow path.






# Entry API

As we have noted, abstractions are not a panacea. A bad abstraction can end up
producing more work the designers and users of the abstraction. A notable example
of this was the old `find_or` API for maps. The motivation for the API was simple:
maps are often used as key accumulators, requiring different logic to be performed
the first time a key is encountered. This is of course true in general. The map
data structure must do something special when inserting a genuinely new key,
instead of just replacing one. However in the case of accumulators, the *user*
of the map needs to do something special.

Consider using a map to count the number of occurrences of different strings. The
first time a key is found, we would like to simply insert the value `1`. However
ever subsequent insertion, we instead want to increment the value stored under
the key. This is fairly easy to implement using standard map APIs:

```rust
if let Some(count) = map.get_mut(&key) {
    *count += 1;
} else {
    map.insert(key, 1);
}
```

But this design has a frustrating performance issue: in the `else`
case, we end up doing two lookups in the map. The standard library's initial
solution to this problem was to expose a new method that allowed the user to
specify a default value, `find_or_insert(key, default_value)`. This handles
the simple counter case perfectly well:

```rust
*map.find_or_insert(&key, 0) += 1;
```

But it may be the case the the value is too expensive (or incorrect) to compute
unconditionally. To address this, a new method was added that allows a function
to be passed that will compute the value by-need, `find_or_insert_with(key, default_function)`.

From there it got ever more out of control. It may be the case that the operation
you want to perform after the insertion depends on whether the key was new or not,
and this design doesn't expose that information.

Eventually, this culminated in the following monstrosity (updated to modern Rust):

```rust
fn find_with_or_insert_with<A, F, NF>(&mut self, k: K, a: A, found: F, not_found: NF) -> &mut V
    where F: FnOnce(&K, &mut V, A)
          FN: FnOnce(&K, A) -> V
```

`find_with_or_insert_with` takes two functions: one to execute if the key existed, and one
to execute if the key didn't exist. But because of this design, we end up with this curious
`A` type mixed in. What is the purpose of this value? Well, normally if you wanted a
function to use some local data, you would use a closure. Unfortunately, two closures can't
close over the same value if it's affine. In this case, we know only one of the closures
will be executed, so we can soundly close over the same piece of data twice. In order
to encode this, we have the user manually pass in the state to be closed over.

What a nightmare!

It's easy to conclude that this is, to some extent, ownership's fault. Certainly
the closure trick would be unnecessary in a garbage-collected language. However
this is actually just a bad abstraction. We instead replaced this API with a
completely different one: the `entry` API.

Instead of a handful of increasingly inscrutable methods to achieve this functionality,
we only have one, `entry(key)`
