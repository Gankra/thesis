Since Rust's model of ownership is built up of well-establised parts, it should
surprise no one to learn that other languages have been built with similar
designs. Of particular interest is C++, Cyclone, and Alms.


\section{Cyclone}

The Cyclone progamming language is easily the closest relative to Rust. Cyclone
was a project with similar goals to Rust: make a language which can do all the
low-level stuff normally reserved for C and C++, but make it safe. However, while
Rust was designed as a completely new language Cyclone was designed to be a
minimal addition on top of C. The ideal of Cyclone was that existing C code
bases could be migrated to it relatively painlessly. This ultimately limited
Cyclone

Although Rust was not originally based on Cyclone, the version of Rust that
was stabilized can be seen as the direct descendant of the final version of
Cyclone. Most notably, the region analysis employed by Rust and Cyclone for
borrowed pointers is (as far as we can tell) identical. Where the two deviate
is in affine typing. Since Cyclone intended to be a drop-in replacement for C,
it was based largely around copy semantics, and not move semantics. However
near the end of its development Cyclone introduced affine unique and
reference-counted pointers in order to enable more flexible memory management.
These types were built into the language, and no mechanism was provided to mark
other types as affine. As such, affine typing couldn't be used as a mechanism to
manage access to data, because all other data was still freely copyable. Instead,
affine typing was used exclusively for allocation management.



\section{C++}

* Move semantics suck, need to mark the old value as ``moved'', access still permitted (uniqueptr)
* Unmanaged pointers are wildly unsafe; safe abstractions can't expose them
* C++ core guidelines (basically a different language, unproven, adhoc)








\section{Alms}

Alms has affine types, but exposes a more advanced mechanism than regions. It's
sufficient to implement regions as a library notion.




\section{Vault}

Vault uses linear typing instead of affine typing.
